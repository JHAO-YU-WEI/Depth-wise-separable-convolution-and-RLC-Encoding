## CSIE DIC LAB--Depth-wise separable convolution and RLC Encoding

Depth-wise separable convolution and RLC Encoding  

1.RTL coding algorithm design  

2.Synthesis for gate-level simulation.  

3.Use **depth-wise convolution** operation and **point-wise convolution** operation   

4.The output image will be compressed by **RLC(Run Length Coding)** before output.
